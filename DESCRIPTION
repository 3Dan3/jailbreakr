Description: Liberate data from really terrible excel spreadsheets.
    Provides functionality to turn any excel spreadsheet into data
    that can be manipulated in R, and tools to detect "logical" tables
    within such data.  If you have well behaved data you will be
    better off with something like 'readxl' for quickly reading data
    in.
